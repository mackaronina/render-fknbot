# Funny telegram bot for analyzing message toxicity

This is a telegram bot that uses a neural network via API to analyze the toxicity of each message in the chat. The bot
leaves a "ðŸ˜ˆ" reaction to toxic messages and counts their number for each chat and for each user. The bot also has a
web app for drawing and several funny commands for processing user avatars. Try the bot: https://t.me/fknclown_bot
